# Equal weight S&P 500 Index Fund

A project for learning about algorithmic trading using python and jupyter notebook.

An API call is made to import data about the real world stocks of S&P 500 index. Real time financial data APIs are paid, so for learning and testing purpose, a free test data available in sandbox link of IEX_CLOUD is used here. 

The goal of this project is to create a Python script that will accept the value of your portfolio and tell you how many shares of each S&P 500 constituent you should purchase to get an equal-weight version of the index fund.
